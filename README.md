# Exploration4

For this exploration, I found a job listing for a full stack developer for Adknowledge in Kansas City. They are looking for a developer with these skills: 
*	2+ years of experience working with frontend JS frameworks â€“ Angular.js / React.js / Vue.js etc.
*	Experience working with PHP MVC frameworks like Symfony is a big plus
*	Experience working as part of an Agile software team
*	Experience working with Amazon Web Services infrastructure
*	Extensive knowledge of APIs, including RESTful services

We learned about Angular.js, Amazon Web Services and RESTful services in class. I have learned about PHP, MVC and Agile software development in other Computer Science classes. I decided to do my exploration on Vue.js because it is something new that I am not familiar with. 

Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that allows you to work in the view to create a user interface. It focuses on the view layer only, which makes it easy to incorporate with other libraries. I created a simple webpage that gives examples of what vue.js can be used for.
